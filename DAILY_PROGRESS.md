## 📝 **Daily Progress Log**

### **August 21, 2024** - Smart Contract Development & Environment Setup ✅
**What I Did:**
- ✅ Upgraded Node.js from v20.2.0 to v22.18.0 (resolved Hardhat compatibility)
- ✅ Installed nvm (Node Version Manager) for version management
- ✅ Set up Hardhat development environment in contracts/
- ✅ Created 3 core smart contracts for Phase 1:
  - `TreeID.sol` - Unique tree identification system
  - `Certification.sol` - Organic certification and lab test management
  - `Harvest.sol` - Harvest data and quality metrics tracking
- ✅ Analyzed smart contract requirements for Phase 1 vs. future phases
- ✅ Identified essential contracts vs. placeholders for strategic development

**Technical Details:**
- **Node.js**: v22.18.0 (from v20.2.0) - Now compatible with Hardhat
- **Smart Contracts**: 3 core contracts created with comprehensive functionality
- **Architecture**: Modular design with OpenZeppelin contracts integration
- **Data Structures**: Complex structs for tree data, certifications, harvests, quality metrics

**Smart Contract Analysis:**
- **Essential for Phase 1**: TreeID, Certification, Harvest ✅
- **Placeholders for later**: SupplyChain, Reputation, Token (Year 2)

**Files Created/Modified:**
- `contracts/package.json` - Hardhat setup with ESM support
- `contracts/hardhat.config.ts` - TypeScript configuration
- `contracts/src/TreeID.sol` - Core tree identification contract
- `contracts/src/Certification.sol` - Certification management contract
- `contracts/src/Harvest.sol` - Harvest tracking contract

**Next Steps:**
- [ ] Compile and test smart contracts
- [ ] Create remaining placeholder contracts (if needed)
- [ ] Set up backend API development
- [ ] Begin frontend web interface

- ✅ Set up complete project structure with monorepo
- ✅ Created comprehensive whitepaper (Markdown + DOCX)
- ✅ Defined technology stack for Year 1
- ✅ Established clear development phases
- ✅ Set up Git repository and pushed to GitHub
- ✅ Created installation guide and documentation
- ✅ Cleaned up repository (removed setup scripts)
- ✅ Created daily progress tracker

**Files Created:**
- `README.md` - Project overview and roadmap
- `package.json` - Dependencies and scripts
- `INSTALLATION.md` - Setup guide
